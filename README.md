# HDL-Implementation-of-Branch-Predictors

This project dealt with the implementation of dynamic branch predictors in HDL. Three branch predictor schemes were designed using VHDL and simulated using the ModelSim software. 
1) 1- bit predictor
2) 2- bit predictor
3) (4,2) correlating predictor. 
The HDL designs for these branch predictors was compared in terms of performance and cost based on the simulation results.
